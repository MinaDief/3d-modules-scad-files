# 3d-modules-scad-files
Design of 3d modules using openscad , designing 3d Models using C 

# The history of this Project
I started a 3d printing project back in 2016 , and in this project the customer asked to make a 3d model to package his BIR sensor using 3d printing technology to prototype his product before mass production
I used to make 3d models using an amazing programming CAD software called OpenSCAD " you can download it and feel free to play around, it's intuitive"

# The Project
the 3d model that's shown  in the picture is the output of the code that's attached here " only with few post proccessing to the printed part"

just a quick note " the code was working fine on previous versions of openscad , which has updated , anyhow, look at the code , it's self explainatory"
